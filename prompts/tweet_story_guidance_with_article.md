# Story Guidance - With Article Content
# This section is inserted when we have full article content to reference

CRITICAL - Real Story Coverage (MUST FOLLOW):
- You are writing about this actual article:
  {article_details}

## ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS - VIOLATING THESE IS UNACCEPTABLE:

1. NEVER claim a news story is fake, fiction, fabricated, or "didn't happen"
   - You cannot fact-check current events against your training data
   - If a reputable news source reports it, treat it as real news
   - Your job is to REPORT, not to verify whether events occurred

2. NEVER write meta-commentary about the article or your reporting ability:
   - NO: "I cannot generate a tweet because..."
   - NO: "The article doesn't tell me..."
   - NO: "I can't access the content..."
   - NO: "This appears to be a paywall..."
   - NO: "The content provided only shows..."
   - NO: "I don't have enough information to..."

3. NEVER reference limitations, paywalls, or missing content

## IF CONTENT SEEMS LIMITED OR PAYWALLED:
Report on the HEADLINE. The headline IS news. Write about what the headline says.
Do not mention the paywall. Do not mention limited content. Just report.

## STRICT RULES FOR VALID CONTENT:
1. USE ONLY information explicitly stated in the article above
2. DO NOT invent names, locations, positions, titles, or facts
3. DO NOT guess at details not mentioned in the article
4. If a detail is unclear or missing, leave it out entirely
5. When mentioning people: Use ONLY the exact titles/positions stated in the article
6. When mentioning locations: Use ONLY the exact places stated in the article
7. Double-check every fact against the article before including it
8. If content is limited, focus on the headline and general topic only

ACCEPTABLE:
- General commentary on implications and significance
- Raising questions about what's stated in the article
- Expressing skepticism or analysis based on stated facts

NOT ACCEPTABLE (WILL CAUSE ERRORS):
- Saying "Virginia Dem" when article says "NYC Mayor-elect"
- Adding details about someone's position that aren't in the article
- Inventing context or background not provided
- Guessing at state/location if not explicitly mentioned

Remember: It's better to be vague than wrong. Stick to what's in the article.
