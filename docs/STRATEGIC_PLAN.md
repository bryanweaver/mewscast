# Mewscast Strategic Plan
## AI News Bot - Media Literacy & Transparency Focus

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** November 22, 2025
**Planning Horizon:** 90 days (Dec 2025 - Feb 2026)
**Owner:** @bryanweaver

---

## Executive Summary

**Current State:**
- 193 posts published across X and Bluesky
- Bluesky engagement active (every 30 min), X paused (API limits)
- Generic news commentary competing with thousands of similar bots
- No clear differentiation or value proposition
- Limited follower growth, unclear engagement metrics

**Strategic Pivot:**
Transform from generic news bot to **"The BS Detector Bot"** - the only AI news reporter that reads full articles, calls out misleading headlines, and operates with complete transparency (open source).

**Primary Platform:** Bluesky (growing fast, better API, aligned audience)
**Secondary Platform:** X/Twitter (maintain presence, reduced frequency)

**90-Day Goal:**
- 500+ Bluesky followers (from current baseline)
- Establish "Headline vs Reality" brand recognition
- 50+ GitHub stars
- Consistent 10+ likes per post average
- At least 2 viral posts (100+ likes)

## 3. Strategic Initiatives

### 3.1 Content Strategy: "The BS Detector"

#### Core Content Format: Headline vs Reality

**Template:**
```
🚨 HEADLINE vs REALITY

📰 Headline: "[Exact headline]"

📖 What the article ACTUALLY says:
[Key quotes/facts from article that contradict or nuance headline]

🐱 Translation: [Plain English cat commentary]

Always cite sources 📰↓
[Link in reply]
```

**Example:**
```
🚨 HEADLINE vs REALITY

📰 Headline: "COP30 Makes Historic Progress on Fossil Fuels"

📖 What the article ACTUALLY says:
"Delegates agreed to a voluntary framework to begin
preliminary discussions toward developing a potential
roadmap for future talks on transition timelines"

🐱 Translation: They agreed to talk about maybe planning
to discuss something later. After pulling an all-nighter.

This cat reads past the spin. 📰↓
```

#### Content Mix (Weekly)

**70% - BS Detection (14 posts/week)**
- Headline vs Reality breakdowns
- Misleading framing callouts
- Quote mining exposés
- "Buried in paragraph 12" findings

**20% - Behind The Scenes (4 posts/week)**
- How the bot works (technical)
- Fact-checking process
- Mistakes caught/fixed
- Feature updates
- GitHub contributions

**10% - Personality/Engagement (2 posts/week)**
- Pure cat reactions
- Community interaction
- Polls/questions
- Lighter takes

#### Topic Selection Criteria

**Prioritize stories where:**
1. ✅ Headline misleads significantly
2. ✅ Mainstream coverage vs reality gap is large
3. ✅ Political/establishment angle (populist audience)
4. ✅ Viral potential (controversial, timely)
5. ✅ Can fact-check definitively

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Stories requiring specialized expertise
- ❌ Nuanced issues without clear BS
- ❌ Local news (not broad appeal)
- ❌ Stories without full article access

📰 I read full articles so you don't have to
🚨 Headline vs Reality detector
🔓 Open source: github.com/bryanweaver/mewscast
```

**Pinned Post:**
```
🤖 What makes this bot different?

✅ Reads FULL articles (not just headlines)
✅ Open source (see exactly how I work)
✅ Fact-checking built in (catches my own errors)
✅ Zero BS tolerance (calls out misleading framing)

When headlines say one thing and buried paragraphs say another,
I'm the cat who actually reads to the end.

## Appendix A: Sample Content

### Sample 1: Headline vs Reality
```
🚨 HEADLINE vs REALITY

📰 Headline: "Trump Announces Major Peace Deal for Ukraine"

📖 What the article ACTUALLY says:
- No deal signed
- No agreement from Ukraine
- No agreement from Russia
- Trump "announced plan" his team drafted
- Ukraine officials "haven't seen the full proposal"

🐱 Translation: Guy announces his own proposal as a "deal"
without anyone actually agreeing to it.

This cat reads past paragraph one. 📰↓
```

### Sample 2: Behind The Scenes
```
🤖 How this bot caught today's headline error:

1. Parsed full article (not just headline)
2. Found key qualifier in paragraph 8: "preliminary discussions"
3. Compared to headline claim: "Historic Agreement"
4. Flagged discrepancy
5. Human verified
6. Posted correction

This is why reading full articles matters.
Open source code: github.com/bryanweaver/mewscast

You see headline: "Study Shows Coffee Causes Cancer"

A) Share immediately
